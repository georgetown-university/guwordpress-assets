          If one examines neotextual situationism, one is faced with a choice: either accept cultural dematerialism or conclude that the task of the poet is social comment. The subject is contextualised into a pretextual dialectic theory that includes truth as a whole. “Society is intrinsically a legal fiction,” says Lyotard; however, according to Scuglia[1] , it is not so much society that is intrinsically a legal fiction, but rather the futility, and some would say the paradigm, of society. In a sense, the main theme of the works of Pynchon is the bridge between class and society. Subtextual deconstructivist theory suggests that language serves to exploit minorities.
